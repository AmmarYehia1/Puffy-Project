Steps

Open the notebook in Deepnote (a free account works fine).

Upload all relevant input files (14 in total) into the workspace.

Once the files are uploaded, simply run the notebook from top to bottom.

The notebook will generate:

All intermediate tables

Attribution outputs

Analysis and visualizations

The ML model diagnostics

The Production Monitoring checks

And the final Executive Summary PDF

No additional configuration is needed — everything runs inside the notebook environment.
